                <ol>
                    <li>Boil water until it bubbles. The water should be very hot. This ensures the ugali will cook perfectly</li>
                    <li>Add a cup full of flour into the water. Let it cook a few seconds until water starts to cover the flour</li>
                    <li>Use a wooden spoon to quickly start mixing the flour and water</li>
                    <li>Add a handful of flour and continue to mix the water and flour it will start to come together</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to medium and keep turning the ugali as it continues to stick together</li>
                    <li>Gather the ugali and press it onto the side of the sufuria</li>
                    <li>Place the wooden spoon under the ugali and form into a ball in the middle of the sufuria</li>
                    <li>Repeat pressing the ugali on the side of the sufuria and turning it to the middle</li>
                    <li>Once the ugali has become firm, turn it once more and smoothen it into a round. You will know your ugali is ready once you start to smell the aroma clearly</li>
